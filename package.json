He was debating about signing up for a `coding boot camp` and wanted to know which field, job position, languages to learn. This has not been the first friend, so it seemed like maybe I should create a starting point/resource for people trying to learn. This does NOT mean that this will work for all people or that you you need to learn or look into all the things I will touch on, but maybe it can help.",
