# Docsify

> docsify generates your documentation website on the fly.

So I am a person who will push people to document your work. Also in the process of learning how to code you should keep notes. That is what `docsify` is going to help us learn & accomplish. 

> Why should I take notes?

So many things to learn about and a lot of you will forget. So rather then searching the internet, keep track of it. Until you do things on a daily basis or things become second nature you will be better off writing some notes down.
