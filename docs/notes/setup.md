# Setup

So I am running all this code on a 2015 mac book air. Its a 6+ year old personal machine with 8 gb ram. Some of these applications I had installed ( so I had to upgrade outdated apps ). I will try my best to documents things as if your building from a NEW machine.

[Terminal Doc](/notes/terminal)

`mkdir Projects`

`cd Projects`

`mkdir StartCoding`

`touch Readme.md`
