# Start Coding

So a friend of mine wanted to start coding and was not sure where to start. He was debating about signing up for a `coding boot camp` and wanted to know which field, job position, languages to learn. This has not been the first friend, so it seemed like maybe I should create a starting point/resource for people trying to learn. This does NOT mean that this will work for all people or that you you need to learn or look into all the things I will touch on, but maybe it can help.

# About ME

The reason why I will touch on this I think it maybe important to know my background. I was graduating college in 2006 for a BFA in photography and thought I needed to build a website/portfolio to showcase my photos. I chose to build it in FLASH ( language is dead and gone NOW ). As time went on people would say or ask "You know how to build websites, can I higher you?" From there I freelanced taking on small projects and moved to full time positions.

> I am self taught

I never took classes, I bought and read O'Rielly books and just tried to learn different parts of coding a website and when I had a friend who knew about a technology I asked them to show me so I could learn. Now I read articles and watch youtube vidoes and basically try to read a DOC and make things work.

I mainly stick to Front End development. What is Front End. Think about all the the UI ( user interface ) you visually see and interact with when viewing a website in a browser. The buttons, images, animations, and general look and feel. I help to build that portion. 

Understand that none of these resource will be able to teach you about all the complications of building websites or the advanced parts. They will only give you the smallest insight and starting points. The only way you will learn is by real world experiences/jobs actually dealing with the complications of combining services.

Treat all of this like you are a child with your parents sending you to school. You will not really understand the WHAT/WHY you are learning about somethings, but after a while hopefully something will click.  

# Getting Started

So Im just gonna start by creating a basic [GITHUB](https://github.com/) project, this is where you will most likely find this project. Im gonna try and touch on the key things I think everyone should learn and will apply to you no matter what field you are going to go into.

# Development or Positions

### FE ( front end )

The frontend of a software program or website is everything with which the user interacts. From a user standpoint, the frontend is synonymous with the user interface. From a developer standpoint, it is the interface design and the programming that makes the interface function.

### BE ( back end )

The back end of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database. A back-end developer builds and maintains the technology that powers those components which, together, enable the user-facing side of the website to even exist in the first place.

### What the difference

The term “front-end” refers to the user interface, while “back-end” means the server, application and database that work behind the scenes to deliver information to the user. The user enters a request through the interface.

### What is Full Stack

Full Stack Developer is a software expert who's equally proficient in frontend (client-side) development and backend (server-side) development. Full Stack Developers are familiar with each layer of tech stacks that go into the making of a software product.

### Which one should I be?

That is completely up to you as individual. Both can pay well and are challenging. I think of it simply as BE serves data, while FE makes the data look pretty. This is a super simple way to think about it. 

I also think somebody should be proficient in one field, but have knowledge about all aspects of the other.

Think also about having a water leak in your house. Do I want to hire a plumber or a handyman. Somebody who is skilled in the one service that I need or somebody who is a jack of all trades, but a master of none.


# My Plan of things to learn

- [Keywords](/docs/notes/keywords)
- Tools
- [Terminal](/notes/terminal)
- [Github](/notes/github)
- Docker
- Javascript 
- Browsers
- Servers

# Application to Download

These are the application I choose to use, but you can use anything you want.

- Terminal Client - [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html)
- Editor - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

- Dependency Issues - [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

# Install applications in Terminal

If your lazy you can just try and install all of this stuff quickly by copying and pasting the code snippets you see below. I would recommend taking a couple minutes reading documentation on each Applications website. 

### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
Homebrew will allow you install applications in the terminal that are not standard on your OS. It also has the ability to install applications on the OS level ex: Firefox via the `cask` service.

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
`

### [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
  
`npm install npm@latest -g`

### [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

`npm install --global yarn`
