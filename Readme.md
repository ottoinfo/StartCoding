# Start Coding

So a friend of mine wanted to start coding and was not sure where to start. He was debating about signing up for a `coding boot camp` and wanted to know which field, job position, languages to learn. This has not been the first friend, so it seemed like maybe I should create a starting point/resource for people trying to learn. This does NOT mean that this will work for all people or that you you need to learn or look into all the things I will touch on, but maybe it can help.

# About ME

The reason why I will touch on this I think it maybe important to know my background. I was graduating college in 2006 for a BFA in photography and thought I needed to build a website/portfolio to showcase my photos. I chose to build it in FLASH ( language is dead and gone NOW ). As time went on people would say or ask "You know how to build websites, can I higher you?" From there I freelanced taking on small projects and moved to full time positions.

> I am self taught

I never took classes, I bought and read O'Rielly books and just tried to learn different parts of coding a website and when I had a friend who knew about a technology I asked them to show me so I could learn. Now I read articles and watch youtube vidoes and basically try to read a DOC and make things work.

I mainly stick to Front End development. What is Front End. Think about all the the UI ( user interface ) you visually see and interact with when viewing a website in a browser. The buttons, images, animations, and general look and feel. I help to build that portion. 

Understand that none of these resource will be able to teach you about all the complications of building websites or the advanced parts. They will only give you the smallest insight and starting points. The only way you will learn is by real world experiences/jobs actually dealing with the complications of combining services.

Treat all of this like you are a child with your parents sending you to school. You will not really understand the WHAT/WHY you are learning about somethings, but after a while hopefully something will click.  

# Getting Started

So Im just gonna start by creating a basic [GITHUB](https://github.com/) project, this is where you will most likely find this project. Im gonna try and touch on the key things I think everyone should learn and will apply to you no matter what field you are going to go into.
